## **_Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub._** ##

My name is 김승철, and my English name is Kay or Cheul. I am currently a Maker teacher at [Daegu Science High School](https://dshs.dge.hs.kr/dshsh/main.do), where I strive to inspire creativity and innovation in my students.

I am currently focused on designing and implementing an innovative and engaging Maker course program that breaks away from traditional approaches and emphasizes hands-on creativity. Additionally, I am working on building and maintaining a robust system to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Maker course.

To provide high-quality education to my students, I continuously study and utilize various tools and technologies, including 3D design and printing, woodworking, CNC machines, laser cutters, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other essential Maker resources.

Beyond my professional role, I have a strong personal interest in deep learning and actively explore related fields to expand my knowledge and skills.

Feel free to contact me at cheul1987@ts.hs.kr if you have any questions about the Maker course or would like to discuss shared passions and ideas.
